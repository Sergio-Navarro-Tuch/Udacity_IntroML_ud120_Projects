# Udacity_IntroML_ud120_Projects
Projects of the Udacity free course of Intro to Machine Learning
This repository include my answers and solutions for the Udacity course "Intro to Machine Learning".
>**Note:** Some of the answers include snippets from other student's. Also, as this course **grants no diploma**, the uploaded solutions in no way contribute for **Academic Dishonesty** and are meant purely as a reference or guide.
