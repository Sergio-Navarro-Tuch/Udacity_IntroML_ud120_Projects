# Udacity_IntroML_ud120_Projects
Projects of the Udacity free course of Intro to Machine Learning
This repository include my answers and solutions for the Udacity course "Intro to Machine Learning".
>**Note:** Some of the answers include snippets from other student's. Also, as this course **grants no diploma**, the uploaded solutions in no way contribute for **Academic Dishonesty** and are meant purely as a reference or guide.

## Getting Started
To install and run this projects, you may check the [environment_used](environment_used) folder, where the complete environment based on Python 2.7 () is included, with the corresponding installation instructions and comands considering an anaconda installation in windows.

The full packages list included in the environment can be found in the [`requirements.txt`](environment_used/requirements.txt) file if you prefer to run on your own installation or previously existing environment.

In the [environment_used](environment_used) Folder, you can find the exported environment named `py27_ML_Udacity.yml`. As listed on the folder [README](environment_used/README.md), in order to install the environment yo should use the following command:
>`conda env create -f py27_ML_Udacity.yml`

Another alternative to install the environment from the `requirements.txt`file, is as follows:

1. First create, name and activate a virtual environment with python 2.7(In the following [link](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) you can find the process example.
2. Once you have active your environment proceed to install with the following instruction:
